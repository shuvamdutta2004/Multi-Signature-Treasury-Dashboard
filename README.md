Multi-Signature Treasury Dashboard
A polished Next.js frontend for a Soroban smart contract that lets signers collectively manage a shared treasury: propose transfers, vote on proposals, execute approved transfers, and track all activity in real time.

Overview
This project combines:

* A Soroban smart contract for multi-signature treasury logic (initialize, deposit, create proposal, vote, execute proposal)
* A Next.js dashboard for interacting with the contract
* Freighter wallet integration for authenticated write actions (create proposal, vote, execute proposal, deposit)
* Read-only contract calls for treasury balance lookup, signer registration checks, proposal listing, threshold checks, and proposal voting counts

The current frontend is designed as a clean operator console with live status output, wallet visibility, voting progress indicators, real-time events feed, and responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

What You Can Do
* Initialize a new treasury with custom signers list and approval threshold
* Deposit XLM into the treasury contract
* Create a Spend Proposal (specifying recipient, amount, and description)
* Vote on active proposals (approve / reject)
* Execute an approved proposal that has met or exceeded the threshold
* List all treasury proposals
* Track real-time activity and contract events
* View local transaction history with execution statuses

Smart Contract Behavior
The Soroban contract stores treasury state with:
* signers (Vector of signer Addresses)
* threshold (approval count needed)
* proposal registry (Spend Proposals)
* voter maps (signer votes cast per proposal)
* balances (treasury XLM balance)

Exposed contract methods:
* `initialize`
* `deposit`
* `create_proposal`
* `vote`
* `execute_proposal`
* `get_proposal`
* `get_proposals`
* `get_signers`
* `get_balance`
* `get_threshold`

Frontend Highlights
* StellarWalletsKit integration with support for Freighter and other wallets
* Live contract response tracking and toast notifications
* Voting progress indicator with threshold status badges
* Auto-polling of contract events feed every 5 seconds using getEvents RPC
* Responsive dashboard layout with separate treasury stats, active proposals, event feed, and transaction history panels

Local Setup
Prerequisites
* Node.js installed
* npm installed
* Freighter wallet extension
* Access to Stellar Soroban testnet

Install
```bash
npm install
```

Run The App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

How The App Talks To Stellar
Write actions are signed with Freighter:
* `deposit`
* `create_proposal`
* `vote`
* `execute_proposal`

Read actions are simulated against the configured Soroban RPC endpoint:
* `get_balance`
* `get_threshold`
* `get_signers`
* `get_proposals`
* `get_proposal`

Configuration lives in `.env.local`, including:
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_CONTRACT_ID=CANWI4UO2NHX3PJD6VDSHTXJHNPRBATL5VRBDCNQATUQW2LUWF4YM4JP`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`

User Flow
1. Connect Freighter Wallet (address: `GBUX3IHQTAIRN3BXVBWZMKFW2CF6FE4QKQWYEDHYGQXL6OQ3YFMN5R3N`).
2. Select dashboard to check signer status and balance.
3. Propose a new spend transfer (recipient, amount, description).
4. Have signers vote on the proposal (approve/reject).
5. Once the threshold is met, execute the proposal to transfer the funds.
6. Track events in real-time in the activity feed.

Notes
* The project is currently wired to Stellar testnet.
* Write actions require Freighter authorization.
* Read actions do not require an active wallet signature.
* If the statistics card or other read calls fail, check the contract configuration in `.env.local`.
